# Rust for Analysts 🦀📊

This repo documents my journey learning Rust using [*The Rust Programming Language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html), but with a focus on how it applies to **data analysis**, especially in **onchain** and **high-performance** environments.

## Why Rust?

Rust is:
- 🔒 Memory-safe (no crashes from nulls or leaks)
- ⚡️ Fast (compiles to native code, no VM or interpreter)
- 🧠 Strict (forces clean, maintainable logic)
- 💪 Great for data-heavy apps like indexers, parsers, and analytics pipelines

## What’s Inside

Each chapter from the book is reworked with an analyst’s mindset:
- Clean explanations of concepts like variables, control flow, and functions
- Code samples tailored to data handling
- Notes on real-world use cases in analytics

## Progress

- ✅ Chapter 1: Getting Started
- ✅ Chapter 2: Guessing Game
- ✅ Chapter 3: Programming Concepts
- 🔜 Chapter 4: Ownership & Memory
- 🔜 Real-world data pipelines in Rust

## Goals

- Make Rust more approachable for analysts
- Connect core Rust concepts to real onchain data problems
- Build reusable tools & scripts as I go
